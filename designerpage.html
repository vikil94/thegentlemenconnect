           The Gentlemen Connect proudly introduce our Co-founder and Co-Creative Director

           Farzam Amirsolaimani.


           "Remove fear and failure from your mind, eliminate doubt and the concept of 'The Backup Plan' and all that is
           left is a mind that programed to succeed and achieve."

           Farzam Amirsolaimani


           Farzam embodies all the characteristics of what a gentleman truly is; kind, curious, compassionate, humble
           and selfless. It is these attributes combined with his educational background, work ethic, creativity and his
           management experience that puts him at the forefront of this company.


           His creativity and attention to detail stems from his successful career as an Interior Design as he became
           one of the youngest in his field to own his own design firm. His focus on creating memorable experiences for
           our clients derives from his corporate roll as a Project Manager and Customer Service Specialist, but it is
           his heart and passion the drives The Gentlemen Connect to be a company that seeks to bring out the best in
           every man so that they themselves can be better to those that they love.
